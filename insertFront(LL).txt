To insert a element(node) at the begining of a linked list 
step 1:A class should be created with Head and Tail as member variables.
step 2: An object must be initialized using a constructor,and head and tail should be assigned to NULL.
step 3: Implement a helper method(function) which will take the data(value) as the parameter.
step 4: This helper method will create a newNode using the node class and set the newNode's value to the value 
        passed in as a parameter, the next pointer will remain Null.
step 5: If the head of the linkedList is NULL initially, then the LinkedList was empty and the
        newNode will be the first Node to be inserted, hence the head and tail pointer will point to newNode.
step 6: If the head pointer was not Null, then make the newNode's next to point to head,and the head pointer will 
        point to the newNode.
